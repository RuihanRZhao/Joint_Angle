The experiments are conducted on the MS~COCO 2017 keypoint dataset \cite{Lin2014COCO}, reformatted into a single-person collection.  
From the original 45\,930 annotated images, each person instance was cropped with a 15\% padding around its bounding box (clipped to image borders) and resized to a fixed $384\times384$ resolution.  This procedure yielded 134\,214 single-person images, which were stored as an independent dataset under \texttt{/run/single\_person}.  For validation, the 5\,647 images in COCOâ€™s validation split were processed in the same way, and this set was used to compute all keypoint metrics via the standard COCOeval API.
