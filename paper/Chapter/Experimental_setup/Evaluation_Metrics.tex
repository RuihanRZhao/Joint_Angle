Pose estimation performance is measured using the COCO keypoint Average Precision (AP) and AP$_{50}$ metrics, where OKS (Object Keypoint Similarity) thresholds vary from 0.50 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 and AP$_{50}$ denotes AP at OKS=0.50.  In addition, we report PCK (Percentage of Correct Keypoints), defined as the fraction of predicted keypoints within a normalized distance of the ground truth \cite{Dubey2023PoseSurvey}.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{mAP}: mean AP over OKS thresholds $[0.50:0.05:0.95]$  
  \item \textbf{AP$_{50}$}: AP at OKS threshold $0.50$  
  \item \textbf{PCK}@$\alpha$: fraction of keypoints within $\alpha \times \text{personâ€“bounding-box size}$ of ground truth  
\end{itemize}
