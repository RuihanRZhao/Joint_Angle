All training and evaluation were performed on a single NVIDIA H200 SXM GPU (141\,GB VRAM) hosted in a machine with 24 CPU cores and 251\,GB RAM.  The software stack comprised Ubuntu~22.04, PyTorch~2.8.0 (CUDA~12.8.1 / cuDNN), and Python~3.11.  Training scripts leveraged Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for faster throughput.  Experiment tracking and logging were managed with Weights \& Biases (W\&B), recording losses, learning rates, validation metrics (AP, AP$_{50}$), and periodic visualizations of predicted poses.
