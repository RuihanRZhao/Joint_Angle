Keypoint localization leverages the Simple Coordinate Classification (SimCC) head \cite{Li2022SimCC}, which reframes joint detection as two independent classification tasks along the horizontal and vertical axes. Given a fused feature map \(F \in \mathbb{R}^{B\times C\times \frac{H}{4}\times \frac{W}{4}}\) (e.g.\ \(B\times128\times96\times96\) for an input resolution of \(384\times384\)), SimCC applies two parallel convolutional projections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{conv\_x}: a layer with kernel size \((\frac{H}{4},\,1)\) that aggregates vertical context and outputs logits of shape \(B\times K\times1\times\frac{W}{4}\).  Squeezing the singleton dimension yields an unnormalized log‐probability tensor \(B\times K\times\frac{W}{4}\) along the $x$-axis.
  \item \texttt{conv\_y}: a layer with kernel size \((1,\,\frac{W}{4})\) that aggregates horizontal context and produces logits of shape \(B\times K\times\frac{H}{4}\times1\), which squeeze to \(B\times K\times\frac{H}{4}\) representing the $y$-axis log‐probabilities.
\end{itemize}
Each 1D logit sequence is upsampled via a depthwise transposed convolution—using kernel size and stride equal to the per‐pixel bin count (typically 4)—to restore full spatial resolution, yielding two distributions of size \(B\times K\times W\) and \(B\times K\times H\).  During training, each ground‐truth coordinate \((x_i,y_i)\) is quantized into discrete bins, and two soft‐label targets are generated by placing a normalized Gaussian (standard deviation \(\sigma=1.5\) bins) at the corresponding bin index along each axis.  The SimCC loss is the sum of the KL‐divergence between predicted and ground‐truth distributions for both axes:
\[
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SimCC}}
  = \sum_{i=1}^K \Bigl(\mathrm{KL}\bigl(p_{x,i}\,\|\,\hat{p}_{x,i}\bigr)
  \;+\;\mathrm{KL}\bigl(p_{y,i}\,\|\,\hat{p}_{y,i}\bigr)\Bigr).
\]
At inference, the argmax of each upsampled 1D distribution yields discrete coordinate estimates, which can optionally be refined via expectation over the probability mass for sub‐pixel precision.

This SimCC formulation eliminates the need for large 2D heatmaps and expensive upsampling layers, reducing memory footprint and FLOPs by over 50\% compared to equivalent heatmap‐based heads \cite{Li2022SimCC}.
